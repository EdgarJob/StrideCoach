-- Step 1: Check current state
SELECT 'Current policies:' as info;

-- Step 3: Temporarily disable RLS to test
ALTER TABLE workout_plans DISABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;

-- Step 4: Re-enable RLS
ALTER TABLE workout_plans ENABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;

-- Step 5: Create new policies with explicit permissions
CREATE POLICY "workout_plans_select_policy" ON workout_plans

CREATE POLICY "workout_plans_insert_policy" ON workout_plans
  FOR INSERT WITH CHECK (auth.uid() = user_id);

-- Step 6: Verify policies were created
SELECT 'New policies:' as info;
SELECT schemaname, tablename, policyname, permissive, roles, cmd, qual 
FROM pg_policies 
WHERE tablename = 'workout_plans';

-- Step 7: Test the policies work
SELECT 'Testing policies...' as info;
